# Agile development 
An Agile approach to creating this app has been applied. GitHub's projects was used to track user stories and implement ideas based on their level of importance for allowing use of the app with no loss of functionality or user experience. 

By using AGILE methodology in this project I was able to deliver a site which had all required functionality and some more. Due to time limit on this project I was not able to incorporate all initial listed features, but this is where an AGILE approach is great. The project displays this by having User stories in the Done section and the ones which decided to be left for future put in the future implementation.

## Colors
The colour scheme used in this project was chosen with simplicity in mind. The colour scheme is used throughout all pages to ensure contrast readability and an overall good user experience.

## Fonts 
Google Fonts was used on deciding on the fonts for the website. "Zen dots with a fallback of sans-serif" was the ideal for the website.
